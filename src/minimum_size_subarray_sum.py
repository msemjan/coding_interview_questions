"""
Minimum Size Subarray Sum (Amazon)

Given an array of n positive integers and a positive integer s, find the 
minimal length of a contiguous subarray of which the sum â‰¥ s. If there isn't 
one, return 0 instead.

Example:

Input: s = 7, nums = [2,3,1,2,4,3]
Output: 2

Explanation: the subarray [4,3] has the minimal length under the problem 
constraint.
